          <a class="accordion__title" href="javascript:void(0)"> What is the best routine for the gym?

          </a>
          <p class="accordion__content">The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and you
            actually enjoy. These two factors will contribute greatly to your ability to be consistent with your
            workouts. Consistency with your workouts and progressing as you perform them is what will lead to results.
            <br>
            That being said, there are plenty of great workout program styles one can do to build muscle, lose fat, or
            build strength. The body composition goals (building muscle and losing fat) will be accomplished through
            similar style workouts combined with differing nutritional principles, while those looking for strength
            gains may need to focus on programs that are centered on the idea of specificity.

          <a class="accordion__title" href="javascript:void(0)">What body parts to work on what days?
            <div class="bmenu x7"><span class="btop"></span><span class="bmid"></span><span class="bbot"></span></div>
          </a>
          <p class="accordion__content">The answer to this question would assume that the person asking is referring to
            body part splits. In this case, the way you split your days likely won’t matter too much, as long as you
            work every body part throughout the week.<br>
            There may be some benefit into ensuring you don’t hit chest and shoulders or legs and back on consecutive
            days, but if you do, it probably won’t be that big of an issue depending on your overall strength levels.

          <a class="accordion__title" href="javascript:void(0)">What should a beginner do at the gym?
            <div class="bmenu x7"><span class="btop"></span><span class="bmid"></span><span class="bbot"></span></div>
          </a>
          <p class="accordion__content">The best thing a beginner can do at the gym is seek out the help of a trained
            professional to assist them with learning the proper form of each exercise. Practicing the basics and
            establishing a solid foundation in terms of form will help a beginner lifter remain injury free throughout
            their life.<br>
            If you are not in the position to hire a trained professional, you may want to proceed working out with some
            level of caution. The same recommendation of practicing the fundamentals still applies. Start off with light
            weight (the bar on barbell exercises) and record yourself performing exercises.</p>

        <li class="accordion__item">
          <a class="accordion__title" href="javascript:void(0)">This is a tittle, simply dummy text
            <div class="bmenu x7"><span class="btop"></span><span class="bmid"></span><span class="bbot"></span></div>
          </a>
          <p class="accordion__content">What is the best workout routine for beginners?
            The best workout routine for true beginners is rather subjective to what the beginner is comfortable doing
            and their understanding of how to perform exercises.
            <br>
            Their ultimate goal will also play a huge factor as well.
            <br>
            Generally speaking though, beginners can start off performing anywhere between 2-4 workouts per week. These
            workouts can be either full body workouts or upper/lower workouts.

            <div class="bmenu x7"><span class="btop"></span><span class="bmid"></span><span class="bbot"></span></div>
          </a>
          <p class="accordion__content">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
            The best workout schedule to build muscle is a workout schedule that you enjoy and can be consistent with.
            <br>
            In addition to consistency, it would be beneficial to have a higher training frequency if the goal is to
            build lean muscle mass. You’ll want to hit each muscle group either directly or indirectly 2-3 times weekly
            to maximize muscle growth.
            <br>
            Some great splits to look into would be full body workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts and
            push/pull/legs workouts.
